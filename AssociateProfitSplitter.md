# Level One: The AssociateProfitSplitter Contract

## Level One is an AssociateProfitSplitter contract. This will accept Ether into the contract and divide the Ether evenly among the associate level employees. This will allow the Human Resources department to pay employees quickly and efficiently. Below are my step-by-step instructions with screenshots to show how the contract was deployed, contract was deposited and transactions completed.

### Compiling the contract

### Adding three address by using Ganache for each employee. Using injectedWeb3 and my base account, I was able to input each address into the employee fields, for payment to be sent using the contract.

### The last step is to deposit the contract and let the balance send the payments to three employees.
